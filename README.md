### Hello there :wave:

I'm looking for Remote work in Rust and Systems/Backend programming, mid to senior level, full or part-time. For the past year I've been developing my Rust skills by contributing publicly here on GitHub.

My LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-singh-067230262).

### About Me

As a teenager, I had digital electronics as a hobby and built circuits with small microcontrollers programmed in assembly.

Over the years, I've programmed in a range of languages (including distributed, asynchronous and multi-threaded) for digital electronics, embedded Linux devices, mobile phone operating systems & apps and web backends. Always with a view to delivering a quality balance of code maintainability and performance.

I enjoy systems programming where reliability and performance are prized. To that end, I'm studying Rust and contributing on GitHub.

I've lived in the UK, Spain and Thailand and have worked with diverse people and organisations from garage-stage startups to multinational corporations.

I feel I'm approachable, responsible, detail-oriented, self-managing and always looking to learn and understand.
