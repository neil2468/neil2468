### Hello there :wave:

I'm looking for Remote work in Rust and Systems/Backend programming, mid to senior level, full or part-time. For the past year I've been developing my Rust skills by contributing publicly here on GitHub.

My LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-singh-067230262).

### About Me

I began programming as a teenager when I had digital electronics as a hobby and built circuits with small microcontrollers programmed in assembly.

Over the years, I've programmed in a range of languages (assembly, script, object-oriented, imperative, and functional), and I've worked with various technologies (desktop, mobile & web apps; backend systems; digital electronics).

My career started with low-level, backend development. However, over time I drifted to frontend development and now I wish to return to systems programming; I'm happiest when tenaciously debugging an issue in a complex system. To that end, I am currently learning Rust and contributing here on GitHub.

I've lived in the UK, Spain, and Thailand and have worked with diverse people and cultures.
I feel I'm approachable, responsible, detail-oriented, self-managing, and always looking to learn and understand.

__GALLUP StrengthsFinder:__ Responsibility, Intellection, Learner, Restorative, Deliberative.

_Thanks for being one of those special people who read to the end! :smile:_
