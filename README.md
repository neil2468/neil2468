Hello there & thank you for your visit!

I'm looking for Remote work in Rust and Systems/Backend programming, mid-senior level, full or part-time. For the past year I've been developing my Rust skills by contributing publicly here on GitHub.

### About Me

I began programming as a teenager when I had digital electronics as a hobby and built circuits with small microcontrollers programmed in assembly.

Over the years, I've programmed in a range of languages (assembly, script, object-oriented, imperative, and functional), and I've worked with various technologies (desktop, mobile & web apps; backend systems; digital electronics).

My career started with low-level, backend development. However, over time I drifted to frontend development and now I wish to return to systems programming; I'm happiest when tenaciously debugging an issue in a complex system. To that end, I am currently learning Rust and contributing on GitHub (@neil2468).

I've lived in the UK, Spain, and Thailand and have worked with diverse people and cultures.
I feel I'm approachable, responsible, detail-oriented, self-managing, and always looking to learn and understand.

GALLUP StrengthsFinder: Responsibility, Intellection, Learner, Restorative, Deliberative.
